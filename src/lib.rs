Voile is a dependently-typed programming language evolved from [minitt].

# Design

## Goal

The focus of Voile is *extensible algebraic data types* on top of
*dependent types*.
It can solve the expression problem without using any design patterns (like
visitor or object-algebra in Java, or finally-tagless or DTALC in Haskell).

We're pretty much inspired by the coexistence of guarded recursion, coinductive
data types, sized types and inductive types in [Agda],
which is nice to have all of them but they do not work very well
as we can see in a discussion [here][agda-bad-bad]
about guarded recursion checker or in [a GitHub issue][agda-bad] about the
incompatibility between size and guarded recursion.
We can observe that sums, records, and (dependent) pattern matching in Agda only
work well when being top-level bindings.

## Features

+ First-class language components
  + Sum/Record
+ Dependent type goodies
  + Pi/Sigma

### Extensible ADTs

Voile supports sum-types (coproduct), record-types (product) and their
instances as first-class language components.

First-class record support is related to [Record Calculus][rec-calc], or
 [Extensible Records][ext-rec], or "first-class labels".
The idea of "extensible record" is that the creation, manipulation and
destruction of "records" can be done locally as an expression, without
the need of declaring a record type globally, like:

$$
\newcommand{\Bool}[0]{(\texttt{True}\mid\texttt{False})}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\texttt{not}&&:\Bool \rarr \Bool \\\\ \space
&\texttt{ifThenElse}&&:\forall A. \Bool \rarr A \rarr A \rarr A
\end{alignedat}
$$

Universal quantification should also support generalizing over a part of the
records (in other words, [row-polymorphism][row-poly]), like:

$$
\newcommand{\xx}[0]{\texttt{X}}
\newcommand{\T}[0]{\lBrace\xx:A, ...=r\rBrace}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\texttt{getX}&&:\forall A. \T \rarr A \\\\ \space
&\texttt{getX}&&=\lambda s. (s.\xx) \\\\ \space
&\texttt{setX}&&:\forall A. \T \rarr A \rarr \T \\\\ \space
&\texttt{setX}&&= [\textnormal{syntax undecided yet}]
\end{alignedat}
$$

Existing row-polymorphism implementation divides into two groups
according to how they support such generalization,
either by making "record type"/"record value" first-class expressions,
or by introducing a standalone "row" (the type of $r$ above) type.

The study on extensible records has a long history,
but there isn't much research and implementations on extensible sums
and the combination of bidirectional type-checking and row-polymorphism yet.
<br/>
Currently, I can only find one programming language, [MLPolyR]
(there's a [language spec][spec], a paper [first-class cases][fc-c],
a PhD thesis [type-safe extensible programming][tse] and an
[IntelliJ plugin][ij-dtlc]), whose pattern matching is first-class
(in the papers it's called "first-class cases").

First-class pattern matching is useful because it solves the expression
for free, which means that library authors using such languages
can split their library features into several sub-libraries
-- one core library with many extensions. Library users can
combine the core with extensions they want like a Jigsaw
and exclude everything else (to avoid unwanted dependencies) or create their
own extensions without touching the original codebase.

### Exceptions (undecided yet)

MLPolyR exploits first-class sums in error-handling -- exceptions
are treated as first-class sums while `try`-`catch` clauses are pattern
matching on them ("consumes" a variant in a sum).
Putting exceptions into function signatures
looks like Java's `checked exceptions`, but with full type-inference.
In this way, we can have cross-control-flow exceptions (instead of monadic)
safely, because it's easy to ensure that an expression is exception-free
simply by looking at its type.

We can denote function from $A$ to $B$ that may throw exception $E$ like this:

$$
A \xrightarrow{E} B
$$

A higher-order function taking an exception-throwing function and handles one
exception will have signature like this (convert langauge-level exceptions to
monadic exceptions):

$$
(A \xrightarrow{E \mid r} B) \rarr (E \rarr B) \rarr (A \xrightarrow{r} B)
$$

However, without the help of dependent types, there can be false positives
such as conditionally-thrown exceptions -- consider a function `f` like this
(assume $e : E$):

```mlpolyr
fun f a = if a then throw e else 0
```

Invocation `f false` is not going to raise any exception, but the compiler
disagrees because of the type of `f` inferred
(something like $\mathbb{B} \xrightarrow{E} \mathbb{Z}$)
is irrelevant to the argument applied.
In the industry of dependent types, there isn't much development on
exceptions. We might have a try here.

### Induction and Coinduction

According to elementary-school discrete math, induction has something
to do with recursion.
However, recursion on sum types is a huge problem against the design of
first-class sum types.

In the clich√© programming languages with non-first-class sums (where the
sum types need to be declared globally before usage), type-checking against
recursive sums can be easily supported because the types are known to the
type-checker -- there's no need of reduction on an already-resolved sum type.
Once a term is known to be some sum type, it becomes a canonical value.

For Voile, arbitrary expressions can appear inside of a sum type term,
which means reduction is still needed before checking some other terms against
this sum-type-term.
If there's recursion on a sum-type-term, like the natural number definition:

$$
\mathbb{N}=\texttt{Zero} \mid \texttt{Suc}\ \mathbb{N}
$$

The type-checker will infinitely loop on its reduction.

The above definition will actually be rejected by the termination checker,
but recursion on sum-types *have* to be supported because we have been using
it for a long time -- we shouldn't sacrifice this fundamental language feature.

We choose to annotate types with the so-called sized types
(present in [MiniAgda]) to inform the compiler about how data size are changed
in a function.
This will also help recursive type definitions, because it acts as an
argument to the recursive call in the type definition!

$$
\mathbb{N}^{(\texttt{s}\ i)}=\texttt{Zero} \mid \texttt{Suc}\ \mathbb{N}^i
$$

This function now perfectly terminates.
We may also write it in a more inductive way:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\mathbb{N}^0&&=\texttt{Zero}\\\\ \space
&\mathbb{N}^{(\texttt{s}\ i)}&&=\texttt{Suc}\ \mathbb{N}^i
\end{alignedat}
$$

Depends on how sized types are designed in Voile.

# Implementation

Voile's implementation is inspired from [Agda], [mlang], [MiniAgda] and its
prototype, [minitt].

[MiniAgda] supports induction, coinduction with sized types.
